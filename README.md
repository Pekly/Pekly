Good to see you, bruh!ðŸ§±
========================

Hey!, this is Pekly's website.

A dude who loves gaming, Tech, and building cool stuff.

I am interested in coding and this is one of my first HTML works. I am proud of it and I will strive to do better in the future!

I will update this list with random, meaningful images monthly as long as the website is up.

I just made this website, and it's very basic, so some things might not work.
